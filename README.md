# Chat-with-Knowledge-Library-Healthcare

## Project Description
**This project is a Streamlit application that allows users to chat with a knowledge library using PDF documents. It utilizes LangChain, Google Generative AI, and FAISS for text embedding and conversational capabilities.**

## Features
**- Upload PDF documents**
**- Extract text from PDFs**
**- Split text into manageable chunks**
**- Generate embeddings using Google Generative AI**
**- Store embeddings in a FAISS vector store**
**- Perform similarity search on user questions**
**- Answer questions based on the context of the uploaded PDFs**

## Setup and Installation
**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Chat-with-Knowledge-Library-Healthcare.git
cd Chat-with-Knowledge-Library-Healthcare
```
**2. Create a virtual environment and activate it**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
**3. Install the required dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**4. Configure your environment variables**
**Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Google API key**
```
Google_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```

## Usage
**1. Run the Streamlit application**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
**2. Upload your PDF documents using the sidebar**
**3. Ask questions in the main interface and receive responses based on the content of your PDFs**

## Code Overview
**The main components of the application are:**

**- `get_pdf_text`: Extracts text from uploaded PDF documents**
**- `get_text_chunks`: Splits extracted text into manageable chunks**
**- `get_vector_store`: Generates embeddings for text chunks and stores them in a FAISS vector store**
**- `get_conversational_chain`: Sets up the conversational model using Google Generative AI**
**- `user_input`: Handles user questions and retrieves answers from the conversational chain**
**- `main`: The main function that sets up the Streamlit interface**

## File Structure
**- `app.py`: Main application file**
**- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies**
**- `.env`: Environment variables**
